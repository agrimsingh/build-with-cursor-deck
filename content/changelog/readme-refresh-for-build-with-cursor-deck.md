title: "Refresh README for build-with-cursor-deck"

The README was rewritten to match the new repository identity and actual project behavior. It now documents the `build-with-cursor-deck` clone path, current runtime stack, and the real local development flow.

Documentation was updated to reflect where slide content lives (`lib/slides.ts`), how typed slides are structured, navigation controls, and the current project file layout. Build and deployment sections were simplified to the exact commands used by this project.
